# Dynamic Programming Problems:

## Problem 1: Solve Fibonnaci Problem using Memoization.

Fibonnaci Formula: f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) if n>2 && f(1) = 1, f(2)=1
This problem is self descriptive.
You should be able to explain the memoization in comments.

## Problem 2: Find Longest Common SubSequence in two strings.

    Given two strings find the longest common subsequence exisiting between
    those strings.

    Example:

        LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.

        LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB” of length 4.
